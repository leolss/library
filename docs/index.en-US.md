    title: Characteristic 1
    desc: The speed of light iteration in the digital world makes products more and more complex, and human consciousness and attention resources are limited. In the face of this design contradiction, the pursuit of "natural" interaction will be the persistent direction of smart design.

    title: Characteristic 2
    desc: According to cognitive psychology, about 80% of external information is obtained through visual channels. The most important visual elements in interface design, including layout, color, illustration, icon, etc., should fully absorb the laws of nature, so as to reduce the user's cognitive cost and bring a real and smooth feeling. In some scenes, timely adding other perception channels such as hearing and touch can create a richer and natural product experience.

    desc: According to cognitive psychology, about 80% of external information is obtained through visual channels. The most important visual elements in interface design, including layout, color, illustration, icon, etc., should fully absorb the laws of nature, so as to reduce the user's cognitive cost and bring a real and smooth feeling. In some scenarios, timely adding auditory, tactile and other perception channels can create a richer and natural product experience. In the interaction with the system, the designer should fully understand the relationship among users, system roles and task objectives, and organize system functions and services in a scenario. At the same time, it is supplemented by strategies such as behavior analysis, artificial intelligence, sensors and metadata to provide active services to help users make decisions and reduce operations, so as to save users' mental and physical strength and make human-computer interaction more natural.
